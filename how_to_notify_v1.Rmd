Motivation: sometimes we have a long-running R job that we leave alone while we do other things, and when this happens, it would be nice if R notified us when it was done. Below we'll walk through how to automate having R send you an: email, text message, Slack message, or MSFT Teams message.

### Email
```{r Email Chunk, echo=TRUE, eval=FALSE}
library(blastula)

# First let's build a rich HTML email using library(blastula)
owl <- compose_email(body = md(c("Hello from Hogwarts. <br><br> The polyjuice potion is complete!")))

# Second, store credentials to send our message via smtp; using gmail here but could be others.
create_smtp_creds_file(
  file = "gmail_creds",
  user = "name@gmail.com",
  provider = "gmail"
) # Note, a pop up will ask for the pwd for the user you provided

# Third, send the email using gmail here but could be others
owl %>%
  smtp_send(
    to = "someone@email.com",
    from = "name@gmail.com",
    subject = "Mischief Managed",
    credentials = creds_file("gmail_creds")
  )
```

### Text
If you prefer to get notifications via text messages then you can use the old trick to email a phone number. Each mobile phone plan provider has a slightly different format for how to do this and so the first step is to google "how to send email to text" and look yours up, e.g. AT&T's is the `ten-digit-phone-number@mms.att.net`. Let's run through an example.

```{r Text Chunk, echo=TRUE, eval=FALSE}
owl2 <- ""
owl2 %>%
  smtp_send(
    to = "6263540686@mms.att.net", 
    from = "rbrianlaw@gmail.com",
    subject = "Mischief Managed",
    credentials = creds_file("gmail_creds")
  )
```
Note that the text message above will only render the subject line currently but you can tinker further.

### Slack
Who knew that chat rooms would make such a comeback? If you use Slack and want to send a message there, you can do so using R. Here we'll walk through a stripped down method that posts messages directly to the Slack API using an RStudio library `httr`. If you want to get fancy there is also `library(slackr)`, which has more control and features. 

There are a few steps to set things up. First, you will need a Slack account. Second, go to api.slack.com/apps and login.

Third, click on "Create New App". Fourth, on the left sidebar, click on "Incoming Webhooks" and make sure "Activate Incoming Webhooks" is "On".

Then, scroll to the bottom of the page and click "Add New Webhook to WorkSpace".

Next, choose what Slack channel you want to generate a webhook to connect with, for example, your own Slack username, or a more general Slack channel at your company, like "cat_photos".

Lastly, click on the "Copy" button to copy the webhook, which is what we'll use in our R code below to actually send the message.

```{r echo=TRUE, eval=FALSE}
library(httr)
test_msg <- list(text="hello world!")

hook_to_me <- "https://hooks.slack.com/services/some_long_hash"
POST(hook_to_me, encode = "json", body = test_msg)

if (2 < 3) { # make this conditional
  hook_to_cats_channel <- "https://hooks.slack.com/services/some_long_hash"
  POST(hook_to_cats_channel, encode = "json", body = test_msg)
}
```

### MSFT Teams
